# YourControls_SWS_PC12
Profile to work with YourControls application and MSFS2020. If you find any bugs, please contact me on YourControls Discord: Dkgolfnut_Dennis 

# Known Issues:
  # Yokes may not be Synched. I added logic to L:ARI_AileronInput and L:ARI_RudderInput to see if that helps. SWS uses that for Coordinating Aileron and Rudder
    # Condition Lever does into move/Synchronize. You and your tester will have to move the Condition Lever from OFF to the IDLE and High  positions manually.
    # This is an issue with the model using B:Events that Your Controls doesn't have the capability to use.
  # Switches for DEICE (BOOTS, LH WSH and RH WSH) can not be synchronized due to OVAR's not being used by YC.
  # 4 KNOBS on Pilot, SEC, CoPILOT, Flood can not be synchronized due to B:Events and OVAR's not being used by YC.
# FIXED:
  # All Light switches and knobs on the pedestal
  # Numerous switches on Overhead panel
# Added:
  # Added Logic for Lavatory Doors in Cabin and Main Exit
  # Added Front Pilot Window open/close functions
  # Rudder Pedal adjustment levers
  # Hide Yokes Hide Pilot & Copilot
  # Moveable or hide SunShades (Cabin area windows and Main Cockpit), Moveable seats, tray tables and Arm rests

I recommend that you and your co-pilot first conduct a test flight to check if everything is working properly.
